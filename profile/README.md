Mech-Mind is an industry-leading company focusing on industrial 3D cameras and AI-powered software for intelligent robotics.
By combining 3D vision with AI technology, Mech-Mind brings automation to the next level and empowers partners and system integrators to manage the most challenging automation tasks, including bin picking, depalletizing & palletizing, picking & placing, assembly, and inspection.

Mech-Mind products are developed for easy integration with other systems, and this page provides you with resources that can aid you in achieving such integration.

## Resources for Mech-Eye Industrial 3D Camera

Through Mech-Eye SDK, you can control Mech-Eye Industrial 3D Camera to obtain images and point clouds. Available for Windows and Linux, Mech-Eye SDK includes the native application programming interface, Mech-Eye API, and the GenICam interface for the camera. Mech-Eye API is available in C++, C#, and Python, and we also provide ROS 1 and ROS 2 interfaces for communicating with the camera.

Mech-Eye API and the latest GenICam interface are included in Mech-Eye SDK. After installing Mech-Eye SDK, you can download example programs and ROS interfaces from this page.

### Download Mech-Eye SDK

To use Mech-Eye API or the GenICam interface, please install Mech-Eye SDK first. The latest version of Mech-Eye SDK is recommended for more comprehensive functionality and better stability.

You can download Mech-Eye SDK from [Mech-Mind Online Community](https://downloads.mech-mind.com/?tab=tab-sdk).
