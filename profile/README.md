## Resources for Mech-Eye Industrial 3D Camera

Through Mech-Eye SDK, you can control Mech-Eye Industrial 3D Camera (hereinafter referred to as "the camera") to obtain images and point clouds. Available for Windows and Linux, Mech-Eye SDK includes Mech-Eye API (the native API) and the GenICam interface for the camera. Mech-Eye API is available for C++, C#, and Python. ROS 1 and ROS 2 interfaces are also provided for communicating with the camera. 

After installing Mech-Eye SDK, you can download samples and ROS interfaces.


### Download Mech-Eye SDK

You can download Mech-Eye SDK from [Mech-Mind Download Center](https://downloads.mech-mind.com/?tab=tab-sdk). The latest version of Mech-Eye SDK is recommended for more comprehensive functionality and better stability.

### Samples of Mech-Eye API

The following samples are provided:

- [**C++ samples**](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mecheye_cpp_samples)
- [**C# samples**](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mecheye_csharp_samples)
- [**Python samples**](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mecheye_python_samples)"

### ROS Interfaces of Mech-Eye Industrial 3D Camera

To integrate the camera with ROS projects, download and install the ROS interface:

- [**ROS 1 interface**](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mecheye_ros_interface)
- [**ROS 2 interface**](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mecheye_ros2_interface)

### Samples of Third-Party Machine Vision Software

The camera can also be controlled by third-party machine vision software through Mech-Eye API or the GenICam interface. 

The following samples are provided:

- [**HALCON samples** (GenICam interface)](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mecheye_halcon_samples)

## Resources for Mech-DLK SDK

As a secondary development software kit specifically designed for Mech-DLK, Mech-DLK SDK aims to help you easily implement deep learning inference in the software systems. With Mech-DLK SDK, you can rapidly deploy deep learning models and flexibly integrate deep learning functionality into your own applications without relying on Mech-Vision. Currently, development in C language is supported. 

You can apply Mech-DLK SDK to implement inference with models exported from Mech-DLK (version 2.4.2 or above).

### Download Mech-DLK SDK

You can download Mech-DLK SDK from [Mech-Mind Download Center](https://downloads.mech-mind.com/?tab=tab-dlk-sdk).

### Samples of Mech-DLK SDK

The following samples are provided:

- [**C samples**](https://github.com/MechMindRobotics/Docs_DLK_SDK/tree/main/dlk-sdk-manual_en/modules/sampleshttps://github.com/MechMindRobotics/mecheye_cpp_samples)
